# PipeWeb
Web Application that will illustrate pipeline diagrams in either a pipelined or single-cycle MIPS processor

> parses instructions
> displays MIPs processor pipelined both with and without forwarding

# Features Still In Development

	- Frontend 
	- Multiple Instruction input



# TODOs

skip to finish
	- parse multiple instructions

		separate by newline chars
		need a queue to read user input instructions


		first send first user input instruction into pipeline stages

		then enter the while loop where we check if there is anything still in the stages

			call both table-manipulation methods on each user input
